# Clinical Knowledge of Indications


## Catheter Indications 
1. A patient has a specific catheter documented. 
2. Any intravenous (IV) usage or infusion indicates some type of catheter is used.  
    - IV usage includes general IV, IV medication, IV fluid, and IV antibiotics.  Infusion includes infusion, intraosseous infusion, intravenous infusion, and subcutaneous infusion.  
    - Based on the type of IV usage or infusion alone, it is not enough to determine what type of catheter was used.  
3. Catheter procedures indicate that a catheter is or was present because they require a catheter.  
    - Catheter procedures include catheter insertion, catheter discontinued use, catheter removal, catheter replacement, and catheter self-removal.
4. Infusion phlebitis indication indicates that some type of catheter is used.


## Peripheral Intravenous Catheter (PIVC) Indications
1. PIVCs are rarely documented, so any PIVC explicitly documented indicates a PIVC was used or in use. 
2. Leaking IV or an infusion at the arm, elbow, or hand indicates a PIVC is used.  
- IV includes general IV, IV medication, IV fluid, and IV antibiotics.  Infusion includes infusion, intraosseous infusion, intravenous infusion, and subcutaneous infusion.  
- Central venous catheters (CVCs) are deep, so there should not have leakage on the skin. PIVC leakage typically occurs because the catheter dressing is not properly secured or the PIVC is placed near a movable joint (i.e., elbow) and becomes dislodged. 


## Epidural Indication
1. Epidural usage will explicitly be documented.
2. A epidural catheter is the only catheter located nearby/on/at/in the back (i.e., spinal cord). 


## Infusion phlebitis
As previously stated, infusion phlebitis can be mechanical, chemical, or infectious[1].  Regardless of cause, it is documented similarly and can either be a catheter-related infection or complication. 
 
1. Early stage of infusion phlebitis is indicated by an insertion site or infusion with 2 of the following signs: 
    - (i) pain or tenderness, 
    - (ii) red, 
    - (iii) swollen or edema, or 
    - (iv) warm.  
2. Medium stage of infusion phlebitis is indicated by 
    - (1) a vein with pain or tenderness, and 
    - (2) an insertion site or infusion with 2 signs: 
        - (i) red, 
        - (ii) swollen or edema, or 
        - (iii) warm.
3. Advanced stage of infusion phlebitis is indicated by 
    - (1) a vein with hardness and pain or tenderness, and 
    - (2) an insertion site or infusion with 2 signs: 
        - (i) red, 
        - (ii) swollen or edema, or 
        - (iii) warm.
 

## Infection
1. Pus at an insertion site indicates an infection.  Because pus present is a sure sign of infection. 


## Bloodstream infection (BSI)
1. A bloodstream infection is indicated by a blood test with a positive test result and/or the name of the cultured bacteria. 


## Sepsis
1. Sepsis is indicated by an infection indication combined with: 
    - (1) mobility impairment, 
    - (2) high body temperature (hyperthermia), and 
    - (3) frostbite.
2. Meeting the Quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment Score (qSOFA) [2] sepsis criteria is indicated if there is an infection indication and at least 2 of the following: 
    - (1) high respiratory rate, 
    - (2) low blood pressure, or 
    - (3) a consciousness level that is either confusion, verbally responsive, painfully responsive, or unresponsive. 
3.  Sepsis is indicated if there is an infection indication and the National Early Warning Score 2 (NEWS2) [3] criteria for clinical deterioration is met by a combination of:
    - (1) high respiratory rate, 
    - (2) low blood pressure, 
    - (3) high pulse, 
    - (4) low body temperature or high body temperature, and 
    - (5) consciousness level = confusion, verbally responsive, painfully responsive, or unresponsive.
